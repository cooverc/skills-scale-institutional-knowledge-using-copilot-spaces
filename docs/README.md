## Project Management Processes: Overview

OctoAcme runs projects through clear, iterative, and evidence-driven processes. We prioritize:
- Customer-first, data-informed decisions
- Transparent roles and responsibilities
- Risk awareness and effective communication
- Iterative delivery and continuous improvement

Project lifecycle stages:
1. **Initiation:** Clear problem definition, goals, stakeholder alignment, initial plan.
2. **Planning:** Actionable backlog, dependency/risk identification, timeline and ownership.
3. **Execution & Tracking:** Team ceremonies, code/review/test workflows, status transparency.
4. **Risk & Communication:** Ongoing risk management and stakeholder communication.
5. **Release & Deployment:** Safe, documented releases with quality checks and incident playbooks.
6. **Retrospective & Improvement:** Regular reviews, action items, and culture of learning.
7. **Roles & Personas:** Clear role expectations and communication norms.
