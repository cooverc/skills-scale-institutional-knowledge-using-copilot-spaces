# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the central reference for OctoAcme’s project management practices.

This documentation provides an overview of how OctoAcme runs cross-functional projects, as well as detailed guides and templates for each stage of the project lifecycle. It is designed to accelerate onboarding, share institutional knowledge, and enable repeatable, high-quality project delivery.

## Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme’s project management approach is:
- **Customer-first and data-informed:** Value and impact guide every decision.
- **Iterative and transparent:** Work is delivered in measurable increments with regular reviews and retrospectives.
- **Role clarity:** Every project assigns clear leads and responsibilities.
- **Proactive risk management:** Risks and dependencies are tracked, communicated, and escalated.
- **Continuous improvement:** Learnings are captured and improvements are fed back into living documentation.

**Project lifecycle stages include:**
1. **Initiation:** Validate ideas, align stakeholders, and define goals.
2. **Planning:** Break work down, define milestones, and estimate resources.
3. **Execution & Tracking:** Coordinate daily work, track progress, and resolve blockers.
4. **Risk & Communication:** Identify, monitor, and communicate risks and project status.
5. **Release & Deployment:** Ship features safely following tested protocols.
6. **Retrospective & Improvement:** Capture learnings, celebrate wins, and iterate on processes.
7. **Roles & Personas:** Define responsibilities and collaboration patterns.
